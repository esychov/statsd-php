[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/domnikl/statsd-php.png?branch=develop)](http://travis-ci.org/domnikl/statsd-php)


## Installation

The best way to install statsd-php is to use Composer and add the following to your project's `composer.json` file:

```javascript
{
    "require": {
        "domnikl/statsd": "*"
    }
}
```

## Basic usage

```php
<?php
$connection = new StatsdSocket('localhost', 8125);
$statsd = new StatsdClient($connection, "test.namespace");

// the global namespace is prepended to every key (optional)
$statsd->setNamespace("test");

// simple counts
$statsd->increment("foo.bar");
$statsd->decrement("foo.bar");
$statsd->count("foo.bar", 1000);
```

## Timings

```php
<?php
// timings
$statsd->timing("foo.bar", 320);
$statsd->time("foo.bar.bla", function() {
    // code to be measured goes here ...
});

// more complex timings can be handled with startTiming() and endTiming()
$statsd->startTiming("foo.bar");
// more complex code here ...
$statsd->endTiming("foo.bar");
```

## Memory profiling

```php
<?php
// memory profiling
$statsd->startMemoryProfile('memory.foo');
// some complex code goes here ...
$statsd->endMemoryProfile('memory.foo');

// report peak usage
$statsd->memory('foo.memory_peak_usage');
```

## Gauges

statsd supports gauges, arbitrary values which can be recorded.

```php
<?php
$statsd->gauge('foobar', 3);
```

## disabling sending of metrics

To disable sending any metrics, you can use the `StatsdBlackhole` connection class instead of the default socket abstraction. This may be incredibly useful for feature flags.
